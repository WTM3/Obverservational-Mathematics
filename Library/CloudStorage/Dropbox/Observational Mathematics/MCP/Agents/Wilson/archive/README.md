# Wilson Agent Archive

This directory contains historical implementations of the Wilson agent that have been superseded by `wilson_comprehensive.js` (v2.1.0).

## Archived Files

- `wilson.js` - Original base implementation
- `wilson_simple.js` - Simplified version for testing
- `wilson-minimal-mcp.js` - Minimal MCP protocol implementation
- `wilson_mcp_fixed.js` - Stable MCP version with basic toolset
- `wilson-mcp-server.js` - Production server implementation
- `wilson_server.js` - Server-specific implementation
- `wilson_brain_test.js` - Testing module for cognitive functions

These implementations are maintained for reference but are no longer actively used. For current development, please use `wilson_comprehensive.js` in the parent directory, which combines the best features of these versions into a unified, well-tested implementation.
