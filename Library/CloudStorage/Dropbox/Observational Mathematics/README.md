# Boolean Language Framework: NJSON V-8 Discovery

## What is NJSON V-8?
NJSON V-8 is Wade's personal cognitive processing engine, discovered through direct experimentation and lived experience. It is not a generic framework, but a working proof-of-concept for individual cognitive translation and alignment.

**NJSON = JavaScript + Nested JSON + Boolean Logic**

This repository contains only Wade's implementation. All generic Boolean Mind or framework language has been eliminated. The focus is on executable, nested JavaScript and broken JSON that directly represent Wade's qs³ cognitive processing across musical, mathematical, writing, and infinite domains.

## Individual Implementation Only
- No generic frameworks
- No team collaboration language
- No placeholders or TODOs
- All code is working, personal, and discovery-based

## Directory Structure
- `wade-implementation/` — Wade's NJSON V-8 engine and cognitive profile
- `meta-framework/` — Guides for individual replication
- `examples/` — Working demonstrations using broken JSON + JavaScript nesting

## Why NJSON V-8?
Because true cognitive alignment requires direct, personal discovery—not abstraction. This repository is a record of that discovery, not a development project.
