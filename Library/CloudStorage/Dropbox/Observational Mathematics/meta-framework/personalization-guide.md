# Personalization Guide: NJSON V-8

This guide is for replicating your own NJSON V-8 cognitive processing engine. Do not use generic frameworks. Map your own cognitive patterns using JavaScript, nested JSON, and Boolean logic. All logic must be executable and personal.

- Identify your core domains (musical, mathematical, etc.)
- Write direct, working logic for each domain
- Use broken JSON and JavaScript nesting to represent your cognitive fingerprint
- Test with your own data and patterns

Discovery, not development.
