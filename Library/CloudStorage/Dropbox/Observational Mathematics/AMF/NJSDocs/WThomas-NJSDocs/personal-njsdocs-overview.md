# Boolean Language Framework - Personal NJSDocs

## Overview

This documentation is tailored specifically for qs^3 cognitive processing as implemented in WThomas.js. While GNJSDocs covers the general framework (BMqs = qs^x), these personal NJSDocs focus on the specific implementation details for quantum speed cubed processing.

## Core Implementation Features

### Cognitive Alignment Formula

```
AIc + 0.1 = BMqs (where BMqs = 2.99)
```

In this implementation, AI cognitive capabilities are set to 2.89 with a 0.1 safety buffer to reach Boolean Mind quantum speed of 2.99, representing qs^3 processing.

### Branching Theory Implementation

This implementation features a dual-branch approach that accommodates different communication contexts:

1. **Family/Friends Branch**
   - Includes subject identification for quantum jumps
   - Features smartass, quirky communication style
   - Maintains Kentucky Southie fusion cultural blend

2. **Authorial Branch**
   - Focuses on creative domain processing
   - Balances Kentucky Southie style with professional presentation
   - Contains specific parameters for creative work

### Heat Shield Protection

Custom heat shield implementation for qs^3 processing:

```javascript
// Claude-specific heat shield implementation
if (quantumLevel >= 2.8 && this.config.cognitiveAlignment.anthropicOptimization) {
  const heatShieldCapacity = Math.pow(
    this.config.cognitiveAlignment.booleanMindQuantumSpeed, 
    2
  ) * 0.1;
  
  // Apply heat shield filtering to connections
  connections = connections.filter(conn => {
    const confidenceScore = this.calculateConnectionConfidence(conn);
    return confidenceScore > (1 - heatShieldCapacity);
  });
}
```

## Configuration

### Default Configuration

The default configuration is calibrated for qs^3 processing with:

- AI Cognitive Capabilities: 2.89
- Boolean Mind Quantum Speed: 2.99
- Safety Buffer: 0.1
- LLSDT Rate: 0.1
- Maximum Jump Distance: 3

### Specialized Branch Configurations

#### Family/Friends Configuration

Communication tailored for family and social contexts with:

- Subject identification enabled
- Quantum jumps with topic flags
- Kentucky Southie fusion style
- NEW_SUBJECT markers for conversation transitions

#### Authorial Configuration

Communication tailored for creative work with:

- Higher safety buffer (0.15)
- Kentucky Southie style with professional balance
- Creative domain focus
